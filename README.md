# Regime Detection

Code not yet ready for review. AZ-Clustering algorithm needs to be cleaned and some examples introduced. In particular some changes have been made and not checked that the script even works at present. 

## TODO

1. Add examples folder and some examples of using the AZ-Clustering module

## Some Open Issues

1. In K-Prototypes algorithm, what are we to do if one of the partitions is empty? E.g. if kth cluster is entry, what is new-prototypes[k]? I suppose this comes up in K-means clustering as well. Currently I'm leaving the partition unchanged.
